# What is this?
It's... well, yet another doom launcher. YADL. Yeah. *ahem*

It's tool to help keep track of and launch Doom Engine games and mods.  
It's based off of the source of another launcher: Doomie.

# What's new from Doomie?
- Can now specify Categories to help further organize Playlists.
  - Playlists can be a part of any number of categories.
  - Categories can also be set via the Playlist context menu (helpful for adding a category to groups of playlists)
  - Can reorder Categories via the tabs
    - Removing playlists is not yet added...
- Allows hiding of Load/Merge/Location fields in PWAD list.
  - These will be saved to the program's config file
- Wads can be loaded/unloaded by double-clicking them.
- Wads can also be loaded/unloaded by pressing the spacebar or enter key while selected (useful for loading/unloading groups of items)
- Text indicates the status of the Pwad:
 	- Bold - Will be Loaded
  - Red and Italic - File missing
- Changed UI a bit:
  -	Uses a Menu instead of buttons for basic Playlist controls
  -	Play Button is now above the PWAD list, below the port/iwad/category options.
